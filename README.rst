Candidate groups for representations
====================================

Messy Sage code that takes the dimension and level of a representation 
:math:`V`, and tries to generate a list of candidate (semisimple algebraic) 
groups :math:`G` of which :math:`V` could be a representation.

The expectation is that this is very restrictive if the level and dimension are 
small.
